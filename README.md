# Console-Based-ATM-Simulator
Overview
The Python ATM Interface is a console-based application that simulates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It offers basic banking operations, including account creation, user authentication, balance checking, withdrawals, deposits, fund transfers, and transaction history tracking. This project serves as a practical demonstration of Python programming skills and software development proficiency.

Key Features

Account Management: Create, manage, and update user accounts.
Transaction History: View detailed transaction logs for each user.
Deposits and Withdrawals: Perform transactions to deposit or withdraw funds.
Fund Transfers: Transfer funds between user accounts.

Usage
User Authentication: Enter your User ID and PIN to access your account.
Main Menu: Use the menu-driven interface to select the desired operation.
Transactions: Perform various banking transactions securely.
View Transaction History: Check your transaction history to track your financial activities.

Technology Stack
Language: Python
Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, Python 3.10 (64-Bit)
Version Control: Git
